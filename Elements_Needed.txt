Subsystems:

Hardware-based:
Drivetrain
Pneumatics
Shooter
Intake/Processing
Climber

Software-based, for simplicity
Vision (for accessing values from the RPi)

Commands:

Autonomous/Auto Assist:
Drive straight a given distance at a given angle during autonomous -> AutoDrive
Turn to a given angle during autonomous -> AutoTurn
Lock to the vision target with the turret ->
Fire balls accurately (adjust speed, angle of shot) ->
Locate and acquire new balls ->

Manual:
Drive, general ->
Shift gears ->
Deploy and retract intake device ->
Deploy hook for climb ->
Activate climber winches ->

Manual backup (in case of automatic failure):
Rotate turret ->
Fire shots ->
Operate intake ->

PID Control:

Drivetrain:
Driving straight
Turning to an angle
Driving a distance in high gear
Driving a distance in low gear

Shooter:
Adjusting turret angle
Adjusting hood height
Adjusting wheel speed

Other subsystems:
None at this time

Cameras:

Vision Processing:
Mounted to turret for shots
Inside 'mouth' for ball detection

Driving:
Approximate 'front' of robot (probably in the intake)
On turret?
For lining up with climb bar?
